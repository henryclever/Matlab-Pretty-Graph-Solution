Matlab-Pretty-Graph-Solution
============================

Need larger squares or dots along your plot to see it better? This function helps to space them more evenly. You would think that Matlab would have a built in function to do this, but so far I haven't found one so I built another way to make it work. The squares in the first picture are just positioned in a more simple way by plotting one every '10' data points, which is very simple. However, in the second picture, the squares are placed related to where they appear in the y-position as well--this makes the plot look prettier if you are using it in a publication or something.
